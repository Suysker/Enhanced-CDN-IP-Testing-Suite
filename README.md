# Enhanced CDN IP Testing Suite

Originating from the Cloudflare IP Batch Test Tool, this enhanced version expands its capabilities to not only test Cloudflare IPs but also incorporate support for Cloudfront and Gcore CDN. It comes with IPv6 testing functionalities and allows users to opt for either automated or manual testing based on the geographical location of the IP. An online interface is also available for users to flexibly set test parameters.
